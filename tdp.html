            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled
            programming language with first-class functions.
            While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
            many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
            Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
            imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern
            browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at
            least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
            the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called
            ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.
            Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles.

            PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side
            scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a
            general-purpose programming language.
            It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP
            reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
            PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands
            for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
        </p>
        <p>
            PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in
            combination with various web template systems, web content
            management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually
            processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web
            server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
            The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed
            PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the
            generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a
            command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone
            graphical applications.

            Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for
            general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
            released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
            code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
            It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small
            and large scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
            imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and
            comprehensive standard library.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

        <article>
        <p>All three languages share a common similarity in interpreted scripting
           languages:<br />
           Variables are (by default) dynamically typed (with some exception(s ; ) in
           Python, as you are going to see).<br />
           But whereas JS and PHP can be urged to enforce some level of strict
           typing and provide some kinds of defining a "constant" (unchangeable,
           read-only variables), Python only "enforces" the latter by coding
           standards, or some "tricks" as shown below (for all of you coming from
           JS-Land, you might cry "hurray" at inbuilt im-/mutability for some types).</p>
        <p>Let's first take a dive into JS, where one can use any Unicode character
           and only has to conform to certain rules, as taken from
           <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
            or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        </blockquote>
        <pre>
            <code class="js">
/**
 * In the "olden days" of pre ES6 there only was the "almighty"
 * var - but with - at the most - a little grumbling it could be
 * let (pun intended) out without "use strict". Example:
 */
var MyVariable = "I'm a string but also might be a Number next";
MyVariable = 1;

/*
 * As of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) there came:
 * + let - a block-scoped, local variable.
 * + const - a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
 * Don't think about 'scope' right now, the next section will cover this.
 * Examples for let and const (taken from MDN):
 */
function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}

// NOTE: Constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase,
// but a common convention is to use all-uppercase letters.
// define MY_FAV as a constant and give it the value 7
const MY_FAV = 7;
// this will throw an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to
// constant variable.
MY_FAV = 20;
// MY_FAV is 7
console.log('my favorite number is: ' + MY_FAV);

        <p>Next, let's see how PHP variables and constants can be declared; here,
           too, some rules have to be met, as taken from
            <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php"
               target="_blank"
               rel="noopener noreferrer">php.net:</a></p>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP.
            A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore,
            followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.
            As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus:
            '[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*'
        </blockquote>
        <p>Such, in layman's terms: the (extended) ASCII-Standard minus the
           almighty <strong>$</strong>, which starts each variable and some
           special cases like <strong>$this</strong>. Again they are case sensitive.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="php">
// First to the basics, taken from PHP.net:
$var = 'Bob';
$Var = 'John';
echo "$var, $Var";      // outputs "Bob, John"

$4site = 'not yet';     // invalid; starts with a number
$_4site = 'not yet';    // valid; starts with an underscore
$täyte = 'mansikka';    // valid; 'ä' is (Extended) ASCII 228.

/*
 * As with 'let' in ES6+ above, variables in PHP are block-scoped by
 * default, too. Variables from the global scope may be accessed by the keyword
 * of the same name. Example:
 */
$var = "I am a global variable.";

function testVars() {
  $var = "I'm a local variable.";
  echo $var;
}

echo $var;              // outputs: "I am a global variable."
testVars();             // outputs: "I'm a local variable."

// Whereas the following:
function testVars() {
  echo $var;            // Will give you a PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: var
}

// Using the 'global' keyword beforehand:
function testVars() {
global $var;
  echo $var;            // outputs: "I am a global variable."
}

        <p>Now <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer">constants</a>
           in PHP may be defined in the following ways:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            You can define a constant by using the define()-function or by using
            the const keyword outside a class definition as of PHP 5.3.0.
            While define() allows a constant to be defined to an arbitrary
            expression, the const keyword has restrictions as outlined in the
            next paragraph. Once a constant is defined, it can never be changed
            or undefined.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            When using the const keyword, only scalar data (boolean, integer,
            float and string) can be contained in constants prior to PHP 5.6.
            From PHP 5.6 onwards, it is possible to define a constant as a
            scalar expression, and it is also possible to define an array
            constant. It is possible to define constants as a resource, but it
            should be avoided, as it can cause unexpected results.
        </blockquote>
        <p>These are the differences between constants and variables:</p>
        <ul class="square-list">
            <li>Constants do not have a dollar sign ($) before them;</li>
            <li>Prior to PHP 5.3, Constants may only be defined using the
                define() function, not by simple assignment;</li>
            <li>Constants may be defined and accessed anywhere without regard
                to variable scoping rules;</li>
            <li>Constants may not be redefined or undefined once they have been set; and</li>
            <li>Constants may only evaluate to scalar values. As of PHP 5.6 it<br>
                is possible to define array constant using const keywords and<br>
                as of PHP 7 array constants can also be defined using define()<br>
                You may use arrays in constant scalar expressions (for example,<br>
                const FOO = array(1,2,3)[0];), but the end result must be a<br>
                value of allowed type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of defining constants (from <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php"

        <p>Now on to Python. IMHO it is both the most beginner friendly of these
           three mentioned languages, but has is quirks in defining variables,
           because (from <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">learnpython.org</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed".
            You do not need to declare variables before using them,
            or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now you might say: "Ok, what's the difference to JavaScript?", when
           you hear about objects (as in JS, everything is an object, too,
           have I forgotten to mention? ; ). But without further ado, let's
           start with a simple declaration:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="python">
name = "Guido van Rossum"
print(name)                 # outputs: "Guido van Rossum"

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>And as easy as that you have declared a String Variable (more on Types
           in the next chapter). But whereas in JS or PHP, when you redeclare
           a variable, it get's overwritten, Strings in Python are immutable!<br>
           Let's have a look, what you could do in PHP:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="php">
$name = "Guido van Rossum";
$name[7] = "o";
echo $name;                     // outputs: Guido von Rossum

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Trying the same in Python would give you a type error:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="python">
name = "Guido van Rossum"
name[7] = "o"               # gives you:
'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input", line 1, in module
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
'''
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>And although you seem to be able to redeclare variables in Python,
           in truth a new object of the same or another type get's created in memory:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="python">
name = "Guido van Rossum"
name = "Joachim von Hassel" # A new string (str) object get's created!
print(name)                 # outputs "Joachim von Hassel"
# (Off-Topic: Do you know "Welle: Erdball"? ; )

# And of course you can do this:
name = 104                  # but a new integer (int) object get's created!

        <p>But as written above, more on types in the next chapter. Now you might
           begin to understand, that (nearly) no variable is really constant in Python.
           There are only some workarounds and libraries you can import, but the
           easiest way might be to use a so called tuple, a special kind of list,
           but even that's not unbreakable:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="python">
CONST = ("fixed",)          # The ',' at the end tells Python to define a tuple.
print(CONST[0])             # outputs: "fixed"
CONST[0] = "nada"           # gives you:
'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input", line 1, in module
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
'''

# There's an inbuilt library "namedtuple", which makes this easier to read:
from collections import namedtuple
Constant = namedtuple('Constant', ['fixed'])
constant = Constant(42)
print(constant.fixed)       # outputs: 42
constant.fixed = 23         # gives you:
'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input", line 1, in module
AttributeError: can't set attribute
'''

# But you still could do (not writing the CONST[0]):
CONST = "gotcha"
print(CONST)                # outputs: "gotcha" : /

# Respectively:
constant = "gotcha"
print(constant)             # and again outputs: "gotcha" : /

            </code>

        <p>Usually it's just an accepted coding convention to "Just don't change it!",
           when a variable is written in UPPERCASE.</p>
