            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled
            programming language with first-class functions.
            While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
            many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
            Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
            imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern
            browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at
            least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
            the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called
            ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.
            Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles.

            PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side
            scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a
            general-purpose programming language.
            It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP
            reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
            PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands
            for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
        </p>
        <p>
            PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in
            combination with various web template systems, web content
            management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually
            processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web
            server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
            The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed
            PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the
            generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a
            command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone
            graphical applications.

            Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for
            general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
            released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
            code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
            It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small
            and large scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
            imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and
            comprehensive standard library.

        <p>All three languages share a common similarity in interpreted scripting
           languages:<br />
           Variables are (by default) dynamically typed.<br />
           But whereas JS and PHP can be urged to enforce some level of strict
           typing and provide some kinds of defining a "constant" (unchangeable,
           read-only variables), Python only "enforces" the latter by coding
           standards, or some "tricks" as shown below.</p>
        <p>Let's first take a look into JS, where one can use any Unicode character
           and only has to conform to certain rules, as taken from
           <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types">MDN</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
            or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        </blockquote>
        <pre>
            <code class="js">
/*
 * In the "olden days" of pre ES6 there only was the "almighty"
 * var - but with - at the most - a little grumbling it could be
 * let (pun intended) out without "use strict". Example:
 */
var MyVariable = "I'm a string but also might be a Number next";
MyVariable = 1;

/*
 * As of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) there came:
 * + let - a block-scoped, local variable.
 * + const - a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
 * Examples (taken from MDN):
 */
function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}

// NOTE: Constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase,
// but a common convention is to use all-uppercase letters.
// define MY_FAV as a constant and give it the value 7
const MY_FAV = 7;
// this will throw an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to
// constant variable.
MY_FAV = 20;
// MY_FAV is 7
console.log('my favorite number is: ' + MY_FAV);
