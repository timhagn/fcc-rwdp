## Initializing
After you cloned this repo, having the dist folder, 
the Projects should run out of the box. 
If you wish to work with the files, you have to run an
```npm install``` first, or ```yarn install``` as you please.

To let babel compile your code into the dist folder, enter:  
```npm run watch``` or ```yarn run watch```.
