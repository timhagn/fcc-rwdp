        Terence David John Pratchett was born to David and Eileen Pratchett on
        the 28th April 1948, at Minellan Nursing Home in Beaconsfield,
        Buckinghamshire. He grew up to become the UK’s best-selling author of
        the 1990’s and is known globally as the creator of the Discworld fantasy
        novels, a series numbering 40 volumes. His 2011 Discworld novel ‘Snuff’
        was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback
        adult-audience novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000
        copies in the first three days. He was also a famous campaigner for
        Alzheimer’s research and for the human right to choose a ‘good death’.
